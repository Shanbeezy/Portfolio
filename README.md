# Portfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio of my coding skills up to this point in my career. This portfolio highlights some of my strongest work up to date highlighting some of the best teachings and practices that I've received and put into action. This portfolio highlights the first ever webpage that I created during the prework phase of my bootcamp. It shows how i started my career. It then moves on to the first webpage that I created that has some actual webpage styling. The last work that I have highlighted shows the code refactoring that I did on a previous webpage that I feel enhanced my coding experience. The final showing that this portfolio shows is how I put all of those together to make and style this current portfolio/webpage.
