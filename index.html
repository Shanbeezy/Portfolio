            <p>
                Hello everyone! My name is Shannon James Jr. and I am an apiring web developer. I am 30 years old and I attended the University of South Carolina and Graduated in December 2016. My major was in Hospitality and Tourism management. After being in the service industry for 7 years, I was blessed with twins and decided to make a career change because of the long hours I experienced and also because I wanted to enjoy more time with family members. I've always been good at computers and would fix issues with them whenever my restaurant job would have malfunctions with the systems. It made me realize that I could have a future in doing things with computers. I also remember doing a bit of coding when I was younger on a website called Bebo. I used to change my webpage every other week and I enjoyed it so much it made me want to pursue an actual career in doing it. This brought me to going back to school to actually improve my skillset and learn some actual fundamentals and practices to lead me into a career that I would enjoy and take me back to the feeling I had during childhood. So take a look around at some pages I've been working on and contact me if you like anything or if you would just like to talk. Hope you enjoy!
